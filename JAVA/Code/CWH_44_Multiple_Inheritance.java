        // what is the meaning of multiple inheritance?
        // this means can you use 2 or 3 parent class and inherit into a single sub class
        // this is not allowed
        // this is not allowed since each class have their own signatures and therefore multiple inheritance can be achieved
        // another indirect way of achieving multiple inheritance is by using abstract classes and therefore by suing multiple abstract classes or interfaces it can be indirectly performed

        // a class can implement multiple interfaces and a subclass can access the interfaces and create their own methods and therefore a similar methodology can be achieved
