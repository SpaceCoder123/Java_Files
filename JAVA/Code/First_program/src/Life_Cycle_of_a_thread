The life cycle of thread is depicted the flowchart below

1. New - Meaning the thread is created or kept in front of the scheduler

2. Runnable - Now the thread scheduler has to select an appropriate thread to start the code and therefore a particular thread can be started
and this thread has been selected to run

3. Running - Now the code execution has been initiated

4. Non runnable - Now suppose the thread has been started to execute then it is waiting for some request which is not dependent on the host os,
then the thread scheduler puts the thread into halt state and looks at the other threads and executes the other threads

5. Terminated - The thread has completely run all lines of code and currently exhausted all the lines of code and hence has come to
Phase of completion and has been completed

Now thread can be set as priorities as well which has to  be completed before any other execution and that can also be set

Now the Java virtual machine has a process of stacking threads which are given by the cpu and can run in accordance to the priorities
There are three types of priorities in java
Minimum priority = 1;
Max priority = 5;
Normal priority = 10;
